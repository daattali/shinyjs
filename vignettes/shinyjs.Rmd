`shinyjs` lets you perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny 
apps that will greatly improve your apps without having to know any JavaScript.

Examples include: hiding an element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value, delaying code execution by a few seconds, and many more useful functions for both the end user and the developer. `shinyjs` can also be used to easily call your own custom JavaScript functions from R.

**shinyjs is under the AGPL-3 license. For a commercial license, please [contact me](https://deanattali.com/contact). If you find shinyjs useful, please consider supporting its development!**

<h2 id="overview-main">Overview of main functions</h2>

**Note: In order to use any `shinyjs` function in a Shiny app, you must first call `useShinyjs()` anywhere in the app's UI.**

| Function | Description |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `show`/`hide`/`toggle` | Display or hide an element (optionally with an animation). |
| `hidden` | Initialize a Shiny tag as invisible (can be shown later with a call to `show`). |
| `enable`/`disable`/`toggleState` | Enable or disable an input element, such as a button or a text input. |
| `disabled` | Initialize a Shiny input as disabled. |
| `reset` | Reset a Shiny input widget back to its original value. |
| `delay` | Execute R code (including any `shinyjs` functions) after a specified amount of time. |
| `alert` | Show a message to the user. |
| `click` | Simulate a click on a button. |
| `html` | Change the text/HTML of an element. |
| `onclick` | Run R code when a specific element is clicked. Was originally developed with the sole purpose of running a `shinyjs` function when an element is clicked, though any R code can be used. |
| `onevent` | Similar to `onclick`, but can be used with many other events instead of click (for example, listen for a key press, mouse hover, etc). |
| `addClass`/`removeClass`/`toggleClass` | add or remove a CSS class from an element. |
| `runjs` | Run arbitrary JavaScript code. |
| `extendShinyjs` | Allows you to write your own JavaScript functions and use `shinyjs` to call them as if they were regular R code. More information is available in the section "Calling your own JavaScript functions from R" below. |

### Functions that help you during Shiny app development

| Function | Description |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `runcodeUI`+`runcodeServer` | Adds a text input to your app that lets you run arbitrary R code live. |
| `showLog` | Print any JavaScript `console.log()` messages in the R console, to make it easier and quicker to debug apps without having to open the JS console. |
| `logjs` | Print a message to the JavaScript console (mainly used for debugging purposes). |
| `inlineCSS` | Easily add inline CSS to a Shiny app. |

[Check out the shinyjs demo app](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/demo) to see
some of these in action, or install `shinyjs` and run `shinyjs::runExample()`
to see more demos.

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

To install the stable CRAN version:

```
install.packages("shinyjs")
```

To install the latest development version from GitHub:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("daattali/shinyjs")
```

<h2 id="usage">How to use</h2>

A typical Shiny app has a UI portion and a server portion. Before using most shinyjs functions, you need to call `useShinyjs()` in the app's UI. It's best to include it near the top as a convention.

Here is a minimal Shiny app that uses `shinyjs`:

```
library(shiny)
library(shinyjs)

ui <- fluidPage(
  useShinyjs(),  # Include shinyjs

  actionButton("button", "Click me"),
  textInput("text", "Text")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  observeEvent(input$button, {
    toggle("text")  # toggle is a shinyjs function
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

This is how most Shiny apps should initialize `shinyjs` - by calling `useShinyjs()` near the top of the UI.

However, if you use shinyjs in any of the following cases:

- In Shiny dashboards (built using the `shinydashboard` package)
- In Shiny apps that use a `navbarPage` layout
- In Rmd documents
- In Shiny apps that manually build the user interface with an HTML file or template (instead of using Shiny's UI functions)

Then you should see the [*Including shinyjs in different types of apps*](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/advanced) document.

If your Shiny app doesn't fall into any of these categories, then the above code sample should be enough to get your started with including shinyjs in your app.

<h2 id="usecase">Basic use case - complete working example</h2>

See the [*shinyjs example app walk-through*](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/example) document for a step-by-step guide on how to add a variety of shinyjs features to a simple app in order to make it more user friendly.

<h2 id="extendshinyjs">Calling your own JavaScript functions from R</h2>

You can also use `shinyjs` to add your own JavaScript functions that can be called from R as if they were regular R functions using `extendShinyjs`. This is only suitable for advanced users who are familiar with JavaScript and wish to facilitate the communication between R and JavaScript.

To learn about this feature and see how useful it can be, see the [*extendShinyjs: Calling your own JavaScript functions from R*](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/extend) document.

<h2 id="faq-tricks">FAQ and extra tricks</h2>

There are several questions that pop up very frequently in my email or on StackOverflow about "How do I use shinyjs to do \_\_\_?" Here is a list of a few of these common questions with links to a solution that could be useful.  Note that all of these require using `extendShinyjs()`.

- [How do I show/hide the `shinydashboard` sidebar programmatically?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31306707/3943160)
- [How do I hide/disable a tab?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31719425/3943160)

- [How do I call JavaScript code and use the return value?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34728125/3943160)

I also keep a long [list of various Shiny tips & tricks](https://deanattali.com/blog/advanced-shiny-tips/) for solving common Shiny problems, many of which make use of shinyjs.

<h2 id="more-resources">More resources</h2>

This document is meant to serve as a high overview of shinyjs. There are three more documents provided in shinyjs to teach you various aspects of the package:

- [Including shinyjs in different types of apps](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/advanced)
- [shinyjs example app walk-through](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/example)
- [extendShinyjs: Calling your own JavaScript functions from R](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/extend)

If you need help with shinyjs, a good place to start is to try to get help from the community. I suggest browsing the [shinyjs tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/shinyjs) on StackOverflow or asking your own question there. You can also try getting help on the [RStudio Community forums](https://community.rstudio.com/c/shiny).

If you still can't get an answer to your question, you can [contact me](https://deanattali.com/contact). However, because of the high volume of support emails I receive daily, I can only provide support for a fee (as part of my [Shiny consulting](http://attalitech.com/)).

## Motivation & alternatives using native Shiny

The initial release of this package was announced [on my blog](https://deanattali.com/2015/04/23/shinyjs-r-package/)
and discusses these topics.

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions or feedback, I would love to hear about it. You can either [message me directly](https://deanattali.com/contact), [open an issue](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/issues) if you want to request a feature/report a bug, or make a pull request if you can contribute.

I'd like to give special thanks to the Shiny developers, especially [Joe Cheng](http://www.joecheng.com/) for always answering all my Shiny questions.

Lastly, if you find shinyjs useful, please consider [supporting me](https://www.paypal.me/daattali/20) for the countless hours I've spent building, documenting, and supporting this package :)
