# shinyjs

`shinyjs` lets you perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny 
applications without having to know any JavaScript. Examples include hiding an 
element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value,
and many more useful functions. `shinyjs` can also be used to
easily run your own custom JavaScript functions from R.

You can [check out a demo Shiny app](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-demo/) that lets
you play around with some of the functionality that `shinyjs` makes available,
or [have a look at a very basic Shiny app](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-basic/)
that uses `shinyjs` to enhance the user experience with very minimal and 
simple R code.

`shinyjs` also includes a `colourInput` which is an input control that allows
users to select colours. You can see a live demo [here](http://daattali.com/shiny/colourInput/).

## Installation

`shinyjs` is available through both CRAN and GitHub:

To install the CRAN version:

```
install.packages("shinyjs")
```

To install the latest developmental version from GitHub:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("daattali/shinyjs")
```

## Overview of main functions

- `show`/`hide`/`toggle` - display or hide an element. There are arguments
that control the animation as well, though animation is off by default.

- `hidden` - initialize a Shiny tag as invisible (can be shown later with a call
to `show`).

- `reset` - reset a Shiny input widget back to its original value.

- `enable`/`disable`/`toggleState` - enable or disable an input element, such
as a button or a text input.

- `info` - show a message to the user (using JavaScript's `alert` under the
hood).

- `text` - change the text/HTML of an element (using JavaScript's `innerHTML`
under the hood).

- `onclick` - run R code when an element is clicked. Was originally developed
with the sole purpose of running a `shinyjs` function when an element is
clicked, though any R code can be used.

- `addClass`/`removeClass`/`toggleClass` - add or remove a CSS class from
an element

- `inlineCSS` - easily add inline CSS to a Shiny app.

- `logjs` - print a message to the JavaScript console (mainly used for
debugging purposes).

- `runjs` - run arbitrary JavaScript code (not recommended to use this in a
published Shiny app).

- `extendShinyjs` - allows you to write your own JavaScript functions and use
`shinyjs` to call them as if they were regular R code. More information is
available in the section "Calling your own JavaScript functions from R".

- `colourInput` and `updateColourInput` - input widget that allows users to select colours.

[Check out the demo Shiny app](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-demo/) to see
some of these in action, or install `shinyjs` and run `shinyjs::runExample()`
to see more demo apps.


## Motivation

Shiny is a fantastic R package provided by RStudio that lets you turn any R
code into an interactive webpage.  It's very powerful and one of the most
useful packages in my opinion. But there are just a few simple pieces of
functionality that I always find missing and I implement myself in my Shiny apps using
JavaScript (JS) because it's either not supported natively by Shiny or it's just
cleaner to do so. Simple things like showing/hiding elements, enabling/disabling
a button, showing a popup message to the user, manipulating the CSS class or
HTML content of an element, etc.

After noticing that I'm writing the same JS
code in all my apps, and since making Shiny talk to JS is a bit tedious
and annoying with all the message passing, I decided to just package it to make
it easily reusable.  Now I can simply call `hide("panel")` or `disable("button")`.
I was lucky enough to have previous experience with JS so I knew how to
achieve the results that I wanted, but for any Shiny developer who is not
proficient in JS, hopefully this package will make it easy to extend the power
of their Shiny apps.

## Basic use case - complete working example

*You can view the final Shiny app developed in this simple example
[here](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-basic/).*

Suppose we want to have a simple Shiny app that collects a user's basic
information (name, age, company) and submits it, along with the time of
submission.  Here is a very simple implementation of such an app (nothing
actually happens when the user "submits").

```
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    div(id = "myapp",
      h2("shinyjs demo"),
      textInput("name", "Name", ""),
      numericInput("age", "Age", 30),
      textInput("company", "Company", ""),
      p("Timestamp: ", span(date())),
      actionButton("submit", "Submit")
    )
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) {
  }
)
```

*Note that I generally don't like running Shiny apps like this and prefer to
declare the UI and server separately, but I do it like this here for brevity.*

Here is what that app would look like

![Demo app](../inst/img/demo-basic-v1.png)

Now suppose we want to add a few features to the app to make it a bit more
user-friendly.  First we need to set up the app to use `shinyjs` with two
small changes

1. A call to `useShinyjs()` needs to be made in the Shiny app's UI. This is
required to set up all the JavaScript and a few other things.

2. The app's server needs to have the `session` parameter declared, ie.
initialize the server as `server(input, output, session)` instead of
`server(input, output)`.

Here are 7 features we'll add to the app, each followed with the code to
implement it using `shinyjs`:

**1. The "Name" field is mandatory and thus the "Submit" button should not be
enabled if there is no name**

In the server portion, add the following code

```
observe({
  if (is.null(input$name) || input$name == "") {
    shinyjs::disable("submit")
  } else {
    shinyjs::enable("submit")
  }
})
```

Or instead you can use the `toggleState` function and pass it a `condition`:

```
observe({
  shinyjs::toggleState("submit", !is.null(input$name) && input$name != "")
})
```

You can use the optional `condition` in some other functions as well, which
can be very useful to make your code shorter and more understandable.

**2. The "Age" and "Company" fields are optional and we want to have the ability
to hide that section of the form**

First, we need to section off the "Age" and "Company" elements into their own
section, so we surround them with a `div`

```
div(id = "advanced",
  numericInput("age", "Age", 30),
  textInput("company", "Company", "")
)
```

We also need to add a link in the UI that will be used to hide/show the section  

```
a(id = "toggleAdvanced", "Show/hide advanced info")
```

Lastly, we need to tell Shiny to show/hide the section when the link is clicked
by adding this code to the server

```
shinyjs::onclick("toggleAdvanced",
                  shinyjs::toggle(id = "advanced", anim = TRUE))
```

**3. Similarly, since we don't really care about "Age" and "Company" too much, we
want to hide them initially when the form loads**

Simply surround the section we want to hide initially with `shinyjs::hidden`

```
shinyjs::hidden(
  div(id = "advanced",
    ...
))
```

**4. The user should be able to update the "Timestamp" in case he spends way too
long filling out the form (not very realistic here, and the timestamp should
ideally be determined when the button is clicked, but it's good enough for
illustration purposes)**

First, we need to add an "Update" link to click on, and we need to give the
element showing the time an `id` so that we can refer to it later when we
want to change its contents.

To do that, replace `p("Timestamp: ", span(date()))` with  

```
p("Timestamp: ", span(id = "time", date()), a(id = "update", "Update"))
```

Now we need to tell Shiny what to do when "Update" is clicked by adding this
to the server

```
shinyjs::onclick("update", shinyjs::text("time", date()))
```

**5. Some users may find it hard to read the small text in the app, so there should
be an option to increase the font size**

First, we need to add checkbox to the UI

```
checkboxInput("big", "Bigger text", FALSE)
```

In order to make the text bigger, we will use CSS.  So let's add an appropriate
CSS rule by adding this code to the UI

```
shinyjs::inlineCSS(list(.big = "font-size: 2em"))
```

Lastly, we want the text to be big or small depending on whether the checkbox
is checked by adding this code to the server

```
observe({
  if (input$big) {
    shinyjs::addClass("myapp", "big")
  } else {
    shinyjs::removeClass("myapp", "big")
  }
})
```

Or, again, we can use the `toggleClass` function with the `condition` argument:

```
observe({
  shinyjs::toggleClass("myapp", "big", input$big)
})
```

**6. Give the user a "Thank you" message upon submission**

Simply add the following to the server

```
observeEvent(input$submit, {
  shinyjs::info("Thank you!")
})
```

**7. Allow the user to reset the form**

First let's add a button to the UI

```
actionButton("reset", "Reset form")
```

And when the button is clicked, reset the form

```
observeEvent(input$reset, {
  shinyjs::reset("myapp")
})
```

**The final code looks like this** (I'm using the more compact `toggle*` version
where possible)

```
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    shinyjs::useShinyjs(),
    shinyjs::inlineCSS(list(.big = "font-size: 2em")),
    div(id = "myapp",
        h2("shinyjs demo"),
        checkboxInput("big", "Bigger text", FALSE),
        textInput("name", "Name", ""),
        a(id = "toggleAdvanced", "Show/hide advanced info", href = "#"),
        shinyjs::hidden(
          div(id = "advanced",
            numericInput("age", "Age", 30),
            textInput("company", "Company", "")
          )
        ),
        p("Timestamp: ",
          span(id = "time", date()),
          a(id = "update", "Update", href = "#")
        ),
        actionButton("submit", "Submit"),
        actionButton("reset", "Reset form")
    )
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    observe({
      shinyjs::toggleState("submit", !is.null(input$name) && input$name != "")
    })
    
    shinyjs::onclick("toggleAdvanced",
                     shinyjs::toggle(id = "advanced", anim = TRUE))    
    
    shinyjs::onclick("update", shinyjs::text("time", date()))
    
    observe({
      shinyjs::toggleClass("myapp", "big", input$big)
    })
    
    observeEvent(input$submit, {
      shinyjs::info("Thank you!")
    })
    
    observeEvent(input$reset, {
      shinyjs::reset("myapp")
    })    
  }
)
```

## Calling your own JavaScript functions from R

You can also use `shinyjs` to add your own JavaScript functions that can be called from R as if they were regular R functions using `extendShinyjs`.

### Very simple example

Using `extendShinyjs` is very simple and makes defining and calling JavaScript functions painless. Here is a very basic example of using `extendShinyjs` to define a (fairly useless) function that changes the colour of the page.

```
library(shiny)
library(shinyjs)

jsCode <- "shinyjs.pageCol = function(params){$('body').css('background', params);}"

runApp(shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    useShinyjs(),
    extendShinyjs(text = jsCode),
    selectInput("col", "Colour:",
                c("white", "yellow", "red", "blue", "purple"))
  ),
  server = function(input,output,session) {
    observeEvent(input$col, {
      js$pageCol(input$col)
    })
  }
))
```

Running the code above produces this shiny app:

![Extendshinyjs demo](http://deanattali.com/img/blog/shinyjs-improvements/extendshinyjs-demo.gif)

See how easy that was? All I had to do was make the JavaScript function `shinyjs.pageCol`, pass the JavaScript code as an argument to `extendShinyjs`, and then I can call `js$pageCol()`.  That's the basic idea: any JavaScript function named `shinyjs.foo` will be available to call as `js$foo()`. You can either pass the JS code as a string to the `text` argument, or place the JS code in a separate JavaScript file and use the `script` argument to specify where the code can be found. Using a separate file is generally prefered over writing the code inline, but in these examples I will always use the `text` argument to keep it simple.

#### Passing arguments from R to JavaScript

Any `shinyjs` function that is called will pass a single array-like parameter to its corresponding JavaScript function. If the function in R was called with unnamed arguments, then it will pass an Array of the arguments; if the R arguments are named then it will pass an Object with key-value pairs. For example, calling `js$foo("bar", 5)` in R will call `shinyjs.foo(["bar", 5])` in JS, while calling `js$foo(num = 5, id = "bar")` in R will call `shinyjs.foo({num : 5, id : "bar"})` in JS. This means that the `shinyjs.foo` function needs to be able to deal with both types of parameters.

To assist in normalizing the parameters, `shinyjs` provides a `shinyjs.getParams()` function which serves two purposes. First of all, it ensures that all arguments are named (even if the R function was called without names). Secondly, it allows you to define default values for arguments. Here is an example of a JS function that changes the background colour of an element and uses `shinyjs.getParams()`.

```
shinyjs.backgroundCol = function(params) {
  var defaultParams = {
    id : null,
    col : "red"
  };
  params = shinyjs.getParams(params, defaultParams);

  var el = $("#" + params.id);
  el.css("background-color", params.col);
}
```

Note the `defaultParams` that we defined and the call to `shinyjs.getParams`. It ensures that calling `js$backgroundCol("test", "blue")` and `js$backgroundCol(id = "test", col = "blue")` and `js$backgroundCol(col = "blue", id = "test")` are all equivalent, and that if the colour parameter is not provided then "red" will be the default.  All the functions provided in `shinyjs` make use of `shinyjs.getParams`, and it is highly recommended to always use it in your functions as well. Notice that the order of the arguments in `defaultParams` in the JavaScript function matches the order of the arguments when calling the function in R with unnamed arguments. This means that `js$backgroundCol("blue", "test")` will not work because the arguments are unnamed and the JS function expects the id to come before the colour.

For completeness, here is the code for a shiny app that uses the above function (it's not a very practical example, but it's great for showing how to use `extendShinyjs` with parameters):

```
library(shiny)
library(shinyjs)

jsCode <- '
shinyjs.backgroundCol = function(params) {
  var defaultParams = {
    id : null,
    col : "red"
  };
  params = shinyjs.getParams(params, defaultParams);

  var el = $("#" + params.id);
  el.css("background-color", params.col);
}'

runApp(shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    useShinyjs(),
    extendShinyjs(text = jsCode),
    p(id = "name", "My name is Dean"),
    p(id = "sport", "I like soccer"),
    selectInput("col", "Colour:",
                c("white", "yellow", "red", "blue", "purple")),    
    textInput("selector", "Element", ""),
    actionButton("btn", "Go")
  ),
  server = function(input,output,session) {
    observeEvent(input$btn, {
      js$backgroundCol(input$selector, input$col)
    })
  }
))
```

And the resulting app:

![Extendshinyjs params demo](http://deanattali.com/img/blog/shinyjs-improvements/extendshinyjs-params.gif)

Note that I chose to define the JS code as a string for illustration purposes, but in reality I would prefer to place the code in a separate file and use the `script` argument instead of `text`.

## Altenatives using native Shiny

The initial release of this package was announced [on my blog](http://deanattali.com/2015/04/23/shinyjs-r-package/)
and discusses this topic.
