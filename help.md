# FAQ

# Getting help

If you need help with shinyjs, a good place to start is to try to get
help from the community. I suggest browsing the [shinyjs
tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/shinyjs) on StackOverflow or asking
your own question there. You can also try getting help on the [RStudio
Community forums](https://community.rstudio.com/c/shiny).

If you still can't get an answer to your question, you can [contact
me](https://deanattali.com/contact). However, because of the high volume
of support emails I receive daily, I can only provide support for a fee
(as part of my [Shiny consulting](https://attalitech.com/)).

To report a bug or suggest improvements, please [open an issue](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/issues) on GitHub. I always strive to make shinyjs as useful and correct as possible, so any feedback is appreciated!
