\details{
\code{shinyjs} lets you perform common JavaScript operations that enhance the user experience in
applications without having to know any JavaScript. Examples include: hiding an
element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value,
delaying code execution by a few seconds, and many more useful functions.
\code{shinyjs} also includes a colour picker widget, a colour picker RStudio
addin, and can also be used to easily run your own custom JavaScript functions
from R.
