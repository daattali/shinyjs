\title{Construct to let you run arbitrary R code live in a Shiny app}
\usage{
runcodeUI(code = "", type = c("text", "textarea", "ace"), width = NULL,
  height = NULL, includeShinyjs = FALSE)

runcodeServer()
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{The initial R code to show in the text input when the app loads}

\item{type}{One of \code{"text"} (default), \code{"textarea"}, or \code{"ace"}. 
When using a text input, the R code will be limited to be typed within a single line,
and is the recommended option. Textarea should be used if you want to write
long multi-line R code. Note that you can run multiple expressions even in
a single line by appending each R expression with a semicolon.
Use of the \code{"ace"} option requires the \code{shinyAce} package.}

\item{width}{The width of the text or textarea input}

\item{height}{The height of the textarea input (only applicable when
\code{type="textarea"})}

\item{includeShinyjs}{Set this to \code{TRUE} only if your app does not have
a call to \code{useShinyjs()}. If you are already calling \code{useShinyjs()}
in your app, do not use this parameter.}
}
\description{
Sometimes when developing a Shiny app, it's useful to be able to run some R
code on-demand. This construct provides your app with a text input where you
can enter any R code and run it immediately.\cr\cr
This can be useful for testing
and while developing an app locally, but it \strong{should not be included in
an app that is accessible to other people}, as letting others run arbitrary R
code can open you up to security attacks.\cr\cr
To use this construct, you must add a call to \code{runcodeUI()} in the UI
of your app, and a call to \code{runcodeServer()} in the server function. You
also need to initialize shinyjs with a call to \code{useShinyjs()} in the UI.
}
\note{
You can only have one \code{runcode} construct in your shiny app.
Calling this function multiple times within the same app will result in
unpredictable behaviour.
