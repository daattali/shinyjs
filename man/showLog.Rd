\title{Print any JavaScript console.log messages in the R console}
\usage{
showLog()
}
\description{
When developing and debugging a Shiny that uses custom JavaScript code,
it can be helpful to use \code{console.log()} messages in JavaScript. This
function allows you to see these messages printed in the R console directly
rather than having to open the JavaScript console in the browser to view the
messages.\cr\cr
This function must be called in a Shiny app's server function, and you also
need to pass the \code{showLog=TRUE} parameter to \code{useShinyjs()}.
}
\note{
Due to an issue in shiny (see
https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/928), duplicated consecutive log
messages will not get printed in R.

Log messages that cannot be serialized in JavaScript (such as many
JavaScript Event objects that are cyclic) will not be printed in R.
