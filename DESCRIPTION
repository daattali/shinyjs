Description: Perform common JavaScript operations in Shiny
    applications without having to know any JavaScript. Examples include hiding an
    element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value,
    and many more useful functions. Even if you do know JavaScript,
    'shinyjs' can be used as convenience functions to avoid dealing with message
    passing and writing JavaScript code. 'shinyjs' can also be used to
    easily run your own custom JavaScript functions from R.
