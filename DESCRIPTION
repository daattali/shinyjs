Description: Perform common JavaScript operations in Shiny applications without
    having to know any JavaScript. Examples include: hiding an element, disabling
    an input, resetting an input back to its original value, delaying code execution
    by a few seconds, and many more useful functions. 'shinyjs' also includes
    a colour picker widget, a colour picker RStudio addin, and can also be used to
    easily run your own custom JavaScript functions from R.
