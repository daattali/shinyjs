Description: Perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny apps that will
    greatly improve your apps without having to know any JavaScript. Examples
    include: hiding an element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to
    its original value, delaying code execution by a few seconds, and many more
    useful functions for both the end user and the developer. 'shinyjs' can also
    be used to easily call your own custom JavaScript functions from R.
